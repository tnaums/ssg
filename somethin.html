<h1>Major <b>heading</b> here!</h1>

<p>For my first try, I am creating a simple paragraph that contains
some simple <b>bolded sections</b> and also something that is italic,
like the scientific name of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Hopefully this simple
paragraph will get things started.</p>

<h2>Secondary <i>italic heading</i> here</h2>

<p>The second block, also a simple paragraph. I'm including a code block. It is <code>x = mylist</code>. I need to figure out how to not parse text that is in a code block. This will allow simple things like variable names with underscores.</p>

<h6>Lowest level heading <b>here</b></h6>

<blockquote>This represents a line that is a quote.
All lines must start with
The gt symbol.
</blockquote>

<code>
print('hello')
print(my_variable)
# comment
print('world')
</code>
