<p>For my first try, I am creating a simple paragraph that contains
some simple <b>bolded sections</b> and also something that is italic,
like the scientific name of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Hopefully this simple
paragraph will get things started.</p>

<p>The second block, also a simple paragraph. I'm including a code block. It is <code>x = mylist</code>. I need to figure out how to not parse text that is in a code block. This will allow simple things like variable names with underscores.</p>
